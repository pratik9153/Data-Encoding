# Data-Encoding

Data encoding in ML is converting categorical data into numerical form for algorithms to process effectively and make predictions.

# Types of Data Encoding
1. Nominal or One Hot Encoding
2. Label and Ordinal Encoding
3. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding


#  Nominal or One Hot Encoding

Nominal or one-hot encoding transforms categorical data into numerical format. Each category becomes a binary vector, with a 1 indicating the presence of the 
category and 0 otherwise.

# Label and Ordinal Encoding

Label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category. Ordinal encoding assigns values based on the category's order.

#  Target Guided Ordinal Encoding
 Target-guided ordinal encoding assigns ordinal values to categories based on their relation to the target variable, aiming to improve predictive performance.
